1. I believe the main problem I was trying to solve was helping the clients manage and access course information for the ABCU Computer Science Department. They needed a way to quickly view all of the courses in an organized and structured form. Just basically helping them to managed and organize their courses.
   
2. I mainly approached the problem with using data structures, hash tables, vectors and binary search tree operations and methods. Learning about each one.
   
3. I needed a lot of help with each structure. I have a cousin who knows a lot about the C++ programming and all it's methods. He helped me with a lot of the work in tuturing me. I also had to do a lot of research on the programming and about how each structures work. 

4. I believe that my work in this project helped me by teaching me about how important planning and pseudocode are before actually developing the code. Analyzation, evaluating, organizing and planning all plays crucial roles in coding.

5. My work in this project has helped me evolved in a way that it makes me think about how much more detailed coding and programming is. Well structured code following principles. It dramatically helped with coding and programming.
